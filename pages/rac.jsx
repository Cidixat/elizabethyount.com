  text1: "Regional Acceptance Corporation is an auto loan company whose clients often use smart phones as their primary devices. Prior to this project, though, Regional Acceptance did not offer a mobile product. The goal for this app was to offer an easy way for users to make recurring and one-time payments and to increase the amount of on-time payments each month.\
  \n\nAs the UX lead on this project, I developed and documented interaction designs and user flows through wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes.",

  heading2: "User Research",
  text2: "During the design and development phases, recurring task-based tests were used to gauge effectiveness of the UI. During the first phase of design, an in-depth, weeklong dedicated study was used to rank the appâ€™s usability among its target demographic. I developed detailed interactive prototypes in Axure to simulate the experience for accurate testing. I defined goals and KPIs for the research.",

  text3: "After the release of the RAC app, monthly payments are significantly higher and users can more easily enroll in features that increase on-time payments (such as automatic payments for which enrollment is now available in-app).",
